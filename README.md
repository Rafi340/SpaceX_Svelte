# 🌟 SvelteKit Feature Showcase

This project demonstrates how to build interactive UI features using **SvelteKit**. It includes dynamic list rendering, interactive map integration with **OpenLayers**, and data visualization with a **Donut Chart**.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ List Implementation
A reactive and efficient list built using SvelteKit's powerful reactivity system and component architecture. It supports dynamic updates and renders seamlessly.

### 🗺️ Map with OpenLayers
An interactive map powered by [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/), featuring:
- Pan and zoom functionality
- Marker placement
- Smooth rendering for large datasets

### 📊 Donut Chart
A visually appealing and responsive donut chart built with a charting library (e.g., Chart.js or ApexCharts), perfect for visualizing proportions and data distribution.
